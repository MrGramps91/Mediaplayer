# Mediaplayer
Media player tool

This is s a simple media player tool created in java using the java fx packages

*UPDATE*
25 Sep 2017:
  - in 'Main.java' set video format to a static 1280x760 / added 40 more pixels to the height to display the control bar
  - in 'MediaBar.java' I added event handlers and listenrs to help interaction with the media player, a 'pause' event method
  a 'video time' listener and a 'Volume' listener
